# APOLLO6-F6-.

a prototype to make sharing files more secure on the cloud
this program fragments the image into multiple parts  , each part is encrypted using AES and is sent to different servers. 
For the user to get back the original image each part of the image is decrypted and integrated 
This makes it almost impossible for a hacker to hack into the system and obtain the full image.
